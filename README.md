Inspired by all the publicly available rideshare analysis done in New York, Minnesota, Seattle, etc., and in need of an ongoing project to placate an insomniac's mind, these notebooks represent one individual's peek into the behavior of The Hub.

Data sources:

1.	Primary ride data and station data downloaded from public releases by the city of Boston and the surrounding areas.

2.	Much of the weather data came from The NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Additional weather data related to dew point and humidity came from the Weather Underground website.

Weapons of choice:

1.	Python
2.	Tableau
3.	Excel
